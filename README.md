# Hey, I'm Maninder Singh! 👋

💻 **Software Engineer** | ☁️ **Tech Enthusiast**| 🏋️‍♂️ **Part-Time Gym Warrior** | ✍️ **Poet at Heart**

Welcome to my GitHub!

- 🔨 As a software engineer, I’ve had the pleasure of working on diverse projects, leveraging technologies like **Golang**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Kafk**, **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure** to create innovative solutions.
- 🌐 Passionate about building scalable systems and exploring the latest in cloud technology, I thrive on tackling challenges and optimizing performance and designing robust architectures are my playgrounds. 
- 🧠 Currently diving into **system design** and leveling up my skills in **competitive programming**.

**Outside the code:**

- 💪 When I'm not pushing commits, I'm pushing weights at the gym. It's all about balance, right? 🏋️‍♂️
  - **Favorite routine?** Reps of code reviews followed by supersets of squats and deadlifts.
  - **Recovery?** Debugging... because what's more mentally exhausting than tracking down that elusive bug? 🐛
- ✍️ On the creative side, I enjoy writing poetry—it's my way of debugging the mind.

**Let’s connect and build something amazing together!** 🚀
